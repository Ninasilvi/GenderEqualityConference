            <p>Human rights activist against gender based violence, who has also co-produced several documentaries:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>“About the body”: Follows the lives of four young women in their 20’s who have been severely injured in terrorist attacks. The women go to a body workshop that is run by Ohad Naharin, and Israeli prize winner dancer. After their injuries, many of the women thought they were at loss and were unable to reconnect with the bodies and femininity they had lost. The Documentary details the women’s brave journeys in reconnecting with their once cherished bodies.</li>
                <li>“262”: the number 262 is the amount of calves that were smuggled moments before they reached the slaughterhouse. The documentary follows animal rights activist who fight against the slaughtering of animals, showing the parallels between the suffering of animals and that of humans.</li>
                <li>Details forms of extreme activism used by people in order to get the attention of the press, such as mounting shocking installations where replica-human heads are showcased next to the heads of calfs.</li>
                <li>The documentary also shows the struggles of a group of people that create a sanctuary for animals that they have saved from being slaughtered.</li>

            <h3>She’s gone:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Keren is the creative director of this project</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>International art installation that protest against gender based murder, which speaks for the silenced voices of innocent victims of violence perpetrated by spouses or family members.</li>
                <li>The art exhibition features random garments such as a pair of jeans, a jacket and t-shirt worn by the victims of gender based crimes. The use of garments such as these within the art installation is a testament to the silenced voices of the victims, whose names and details of the crime such as the weapon used and the verdict are found within the items of clothing. This represents the faceless demise of the victims, whose lives were so abruptly terminated by gender based violence. “Clothes that tell the horror when the clothing represents what the victim was.”</li>
                <li>Since 2011, more than 125 women and young girls were murdered in Israel alone, all by jealous husbands, boyfriends or relatives.  Some of these murder cases were never solved.</li>
                <li>The soundtrack for the display features a lullaby sung in 15 different languages, all seemingly overlapping. The languages used were (Hebrew, Arabic, Amharic, Russian, Spanish, French, Persian, Romanian, Moroccan and more, and can be seen as a metaphor for the confusion and panic of the women who suffered such atrocities. It may also be seen as a way of attributing voices to the women who will never be heard again, a minute gesture of expressive kindness. https://soundcloud.com/user-442438005/lullabies</li>
                <li>According to the “she's gone blog”, violence against women is heavily rooted in patriarchal societies that refuse to acknowledge that women are equal to men as well as being unique and powerful beings. This is a point the art installation wishes to raise heavy handedly, and that the crimes against these women brutally violate human rights laws.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>“She's Gone is a private initiative and is privately funded. There are no political agendas behind our initiative other than the sincere concern for the safety and well-being of women and girls, everywhere, and the burning desire to drive a significant change in our society. “</p>
