            <p>Nagore Iriberri, born in Bilbao, Spain is a highly acclaimed economist that specialises in the relationship between experimental economics and behavioural economics. Experimental economics is the study of how experimental models within the field of economics may be applied in order to test the validity of economic theories - ultimately resulting in the illumination of whether these models are viable or not within real-life scenarios. Behavioural economics requires psychological insights into human behaviour to explain economic decision-making. Nagore began her journey within the field of economics in 1999, where she attended the of University of Bilbao Spain. After the University of Bilbao, she moved to the University of California where she completed her P.h.D. As well as being highly respected within the field of experimental and behavioural economics, even receiving the Certificate of exceptional contribution in reviewing awarded by The Economic Journal (among many other awards); she is also a feminist which strives for greater equality between genders. Naturally, the inequality between genders through her studies is exposed at a monetary level, whereby research is conducted to deduce whether there are inequalities between the pay of women and men; and how these values can be quantified through an economic model. Through her valuable work, Nagore Iriberri has been able to expose many gender inequalities within the field of economics but proving them on a mathematical and psychological basis. This is a message that resonates deeply with the moral code of the Ecolint foundation, as many of the guiding principles within both the students and teachers revolve around equality, and offering an experience that is indifferent and unbiased - regardless of culture, gender or any other differentiating factors between people.</p>
