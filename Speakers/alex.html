She was born on April 15th 1963 in Nigeria to a Chinese mother and Scottish father. She spent her early childhood there, as well as in Zambia and Zimbabwe. She was educated in Cobham Hall School in Kent, England. Her journalistic career began with her job at the Wokingham Times, completing a National Council for the Training of Journalists newspaper course in Newcastle while working there. Crawford then went on to work for the BBC and for TV-am before joining Sky News when it was launched in 1989. In 2005, she began working as a foreign correspondent. She reported on the Gulf, Western Asia and the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain and Libya. In particular, her coverage of the Battle of Tripoli during the Libyan Civil War received international praise.</p>

            <p>Alex Crawford’s many achievements are highly acclaimed; she has been named Journalist of the Year on no less than five occasions by the Royal Television Society.

            <p>Crawford has displayed perseverance and determination throughout her career; at the start of 2011, her bosses suggested she take a breather, have a little bit of a break, just a little rest. “Well, that never happened!”, she stated at the end of 2011. She continued her work in Libya that year, and time in time again proves how hardworking she is, despite the danger her job involves. She knowingly once said “You must weigh up whether that risk is worth taking. And at the end of the day, I think that it is.”</p>
